            <h2>All About Them:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Habitat</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        King cobras are mainly found in Asia, especially India and China. 
                        They live near streams around many dense, tree-filled areas such as (rain)forests
                        and swamps because they are cold-blooded and the environmental conditions do not 
                        change quite often.
                    </p>
                <li><h3>Scales</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        King cobras have scales all around their backs, bellies, bodies, and heads. 
                        They are smooth, oblique, and they are normally small and rounded.
                    </p>
                <li><h3>Color</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        King cobras can be yellow, green, brown, or black.
                    </p>
                <li><h3>Prey</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        King cobras are carnivorous creatures. They eat various things such as small mammals
                        like rodents, reptiles like lizards, birds, and even other snakes like pythons. Since 
                        they have such a slow metabolism, they eat only one meal every couple months. 
                    </p>
                <li><h3>Threats</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        King cobras are threatened by habitat loss (deforestation) and human hunting for their skins,
                        for game, etc. Its main predator is the mongoose because it is immune to their venom.
                    </p>
                <li><h3>Venom</h3></li>
                    <p>
                        The amount of venom in a king cobra's bite could kill twenty humans or even an elephant by
                        compromising the brain's respiratory
                    </p>
