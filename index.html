            Playing sports can be extremely beneficial for the human body. It aids with 
            building muscle/strength, weight management, increasing sleep quality, stronger relationship 
            building, reducing stress, lowering blood pressure/cholesterol, lowering the 
            risk of diseases such as heart diseases and diabetes, among many others proven by
            science.

        <p>
            Sports are very fun to play and clearly have various benefits for the 
            people who play them. This website will inform and encourage you of aspects of various 
            sports, such as why one should play them, how to play them, where to play them, and some first steps.
            I feel like this will be very helpful for people who want to find something new to do,
            especially something physical and athletic that can have many benefits.
        </p>
        <h2>The Sports</h2>
        <p>
            The sports that I will discuss are basketball, badminton, running, and soccer. These are all sports that 
            I have played for long periods of my life. I used to play soccer actively from fourth grade to eighth grade.
            I used to play badminton every week on Fridays with my friends, and I was in Brooklyn Tech's club for a short while. 
            I run track & field for Brooklym Tech's team and I used to cross country for their team as well. I play basketball
            once or twice a week at the park near my house.
        </p>
        <h2>Risk</h2>
        <p>
            One big risk that I must warn you about is injury. Getting injured, based on whatever sport you're playing, can
            be very dangerous and very demoralizing. Recovery can take any amount of time depending on the severity of the injury,
            but anything can happen during sports so this is one thing to watch out for, but in my opinion the risk is definitely worth the reward.
        </p>
        <h2>The Message</h2>
        <p>
            Many athletes will say that sports makes your life much better, and I agree with them! Sports can take your mind off a lot of things and encourage you to be 
            committed to something. Also, it's invigorating to improve upon yourself, and sports are a great way to do so.
