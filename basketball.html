        <p>
            Basketball is fun! You can play with 1-9 other people, at it's super simple. It doesn't even matter how skilled you are: 
            you don't have to play a game since you can just go to a court and shoot around too.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            Basketball is played on a court with two teams of five players on each side.
            The objective is to score as many points as possible in four twelve-minute quarters
            by putting the ball inside the ten-foot-tall hoop via a field goal (which can be worth two points of three points
            depending on how far the ball is shot from the basket) or a free throw (worth one point that is given
            to a player from fouls). There are many types of ways to get the ball into the basket, such
            as a jumpshot, layup, hook shot, dunk, et cetera.
        </p>
        <h2>Where to Play</h2>
        <p>
            Basketball courts can be found in many places, both indoors and outdoors. They can
            be found in public parks as well as private gyms. Many people love to play, and it does 
            not have to be the traditional 5v5 either. 1v1s, 2v2s, 3v3s, and 4v4s can also be played,
            except they are normally played with only half of the court. Basically, as long as there is somewhere with a hoop and a ball,
            then this sport can be played.
        </p>
        <h2>Some First Steps</h2>
        <p id="lastP">
            The best place to start is to just get a basketball, go to a court, and play.
            It'd be more fun to invite other people to play with you too, but you can play with anyone at the court
            and build new bonds. Also, it would be advised to buy basketball shoes.
