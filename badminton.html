        <h2 id="first">Why You Should Play</h2>
        <p>
            Badminton is a fun-total body sport! It's fun to play with friends, and it's
            extremely portable because all you really need is a racket and a shuttlecock.
            You can meet a lot of great people playing this sport too.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            Badminton requires two to four players to play. Players have only one hit to hit 
            the shuttlecock over the net. It goes back and forth and whoever's side the shuttlecock hits
            the ground, the opposing team gains a point. Badminton is played to 21 points, where the winning
            team is winning by 2; if not, first to 30 wins.
        </p>
        <h2>Where to Play</h2>
        <p>
            Pretty much anywhere! Just find a spot with adequate room to move
            back and forth and a good amount of space in the air for the shuttlecock
            to be hit. This could be in the park, on the sidewalk, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Some First Steps</h2>
        <p id="lastP">
            Just have fun and play! Badminton can be one of the most casual sports,
            and it's just fun to watch that shuttlecock fly back and forth and people dive
            to prevent it from touching the ground.
