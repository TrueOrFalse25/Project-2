                        King cobras are mainly found in Asia, especially India and China. 
                        They live near streams around many dense, tree-filled areas such as (rain)forests
                        and swamps because they are cold-blooded and the environmental conditions do not 
                        change quite often.

                        King cobras are carnivorous creatures. They eat various things such as small mammals
                        like rodents, reptiles like lizards, birds, and even other snakes like pythons. Since 
                        they have such a slow metabolism, they eat only one meal every couple months.
