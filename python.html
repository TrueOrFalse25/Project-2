        <p>
            
        </p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            There are many different types of running that people can do. Track & field is where
            runners race around a track (normally 200 meters or 400 meters in length) to see who can finish the fastest
            in a certain event, which can range from 55 meters to 3200 meters. Cross country, on the other hand, is where
            runners race on natural terrain (with dirt, grass, hills, et cetera) in order to complete a certain distance 
            the fastest, which can span from 5000 meters to 10000 meters. Trail running has a similar terrain to cross country,
            and road running has similar distances except it can actually reach up to 42000 meters (a marathon) or even higher for
            special races.
        </p>
        <h2>Where to Play</h2>
        <p>
            Anywhere! You can run on public tracks, on the roads/streets where people walk, in the mountains, in the woods,
            on a treadmill, on the stairs/in the halls of one's household, and many more. It's a great way to meet 
            new people (especially before/after races) and get extremely fit!
        </p>
        <h2>Some First Steps</h2>
        <p id="lastP">
            Just get out there and run for a bit! Stay within your comfort zone by starting slowly with low mileage/intensity
            and gradually build it up over time. As long as there is proper recovery (sleep, nutruition, etc.), then improvement will come!
            Longer distances help to build endurance, and shorter distances (provided they're run at a much faster pace) are better 
            for speed.
