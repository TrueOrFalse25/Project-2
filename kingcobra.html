            <h2>All About Them:</h2>

                <li>Species</li>
                    <p>
                        There are four different types of king cobras.
                    </p>
                <li>Habitat</li>
                    <p>
                        King cobras are mainly found in Asia, especially India and China. 
                        They live near streams around many dense, tree-filled areas such as (rain)forests
                        and swamps because they are cold-blooded and the environmental conditions do not 
                        change quite often.
                    </p>
                <li>Scales</li>
                    <p>
                        King cobras have scales all around their backs, bellies, bodies, and heads. 
                        They are smooth, oblique, and they are normally small and rounded.
                    </p>
                <li>Color</li>
                    <p>
                        King cobras can be yellow, green, brown, or black.
                    </p>
                <li>Prey</li>
                    <p>
                        King cobras are carnivorous creatures. They eat various things such as small mammals
                        like rodents, reptiles like lizards, birds, and even other snakes like pythons. Since 
                        they have such a slow metabolism, they eat only one meal every couple months. 
                    </p>
                <li>Threats</li>
                    <p>
                        King cobras are threatened by habitat loss (deforestation) and human hunting for their skins,
                        for game, etc. These human activities are causing them to be endangered. 
                        Its main natural predator is the mongoose because it is immune to their venom.
                    </p>
                <li>Venom</li>
                    <p>
                        The amount of venom in a king cobra's bite could kill twenty humans or even an elephant by
                        compromising the brain's respiratory functions.
