        <h2>Why You Should Play</h2>
        <p>
            Soccer is probably the most popular sport in the world. It is such a fun sport to play, and 
            when there are giant games, everyone gathers as a competitive community to watch it. It honestly
            requires the most overall fitness compared to any other sport, as strength, speed, and endurance are critical.
            It is also a great way to meet new people. 
        </p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            There are two goals at each side of the field. Each team is allowed 11 players on the field. No position like the forward, midfielder, or defender are allowed
            to use their hands except for the goalkeeper; they're only allowed to use their legs, head, etc.
            The main objective is to score the soccer ball past the goal line as many times as possible, and whoever does 
            so at the end of ninety minutes is the winner.
        </p>
        <h2>Where to Play</h2>
        <p>
            You can play at a turf field, which can have their own goals or you could use anything as a post. Pretty much any area with grass is a feasible place to play soccer.
            You can also play indoors as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Some First Steps</h2>
        <p>
            Grab a soccer ball and go play! You can practice with your friends by just passing the ball to each other or using cones and doing drills
            and trying tricks. It's really fun to shoot against each other too. You could also get turf shoes or even cleats for playing.
